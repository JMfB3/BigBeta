What this company is
_________________
We are an app dedicated to improving your climbing. We love data and thrive on the ideas
    of data scientists to build innovative technology in the climbing world.
Right now, we're focused on building an application to surface data about your climbing
    that you can analyze to help yourself improve.
In the future, we'll help you choose training programs based on your areas of weakness,
    suggest styles of climbing you should work on, rate you as a climber, let you know how
    your home gym compares to others, suggest products to help you improve your game,
    build our own cutting edge products, and whatever else we think of down the line.

How to make this profitable
___
Ads
Selling user data to climbing / retail companies
    Example: Based on user's performance by type, suggest different types of shoes.
        Could also do this based on straight suggestions through the app and having partners.
        ie, "you need aggressive shoes - here are our favorites"
